# Welcome to your Expo app ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

**Note:** This plugin is not compatible with Expo Go. Please use a development build, Android emulator, or iOS simulator for testing.

## Get started

1. Don't forget to create `.env` file with reclaim app id and app secret from devtools. Refer [`.env.example`](./.env.example).

2. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

From the options you see, you can open the app in a [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/), physical android device, [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/), or physical iOS device. 

4. Build and run your app

### Android

```sh
# Using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### iOS

For iOS, remember to install CocoaPods dependencies (this only needs to be run on first clone or after updating inapp sdk).

To update your native dependencies, run:

```sh
cd ios/; pod install;
```

For more information, please visit [CocoaPods Getting Started guide](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html).

Start your app with

```sh
# Using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up correctly, you should see your new app running in the Android Emulator, iOS Simulator, or your connected device.

This is one way to run your app â€” you can also build it directly from Android Studio or Xcode.
